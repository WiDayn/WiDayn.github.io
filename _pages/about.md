<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a undergraduate student studying College of Information Science and Engineering(信息科学与工程学院),  Hohai University([河海大学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohai_University)).

My major is Computer Science and Technology(计算机科学与技术), with an average course grade of 87.69/100. 

I primarily worked under the guidance of university professors on medical image processing. I participated in several projects and tasks at the ChangZhou Key Laboratory of Digital Technology on Graphics and Orthopaedic implants([常州市图形图像与骨科植入物数字化技术重点实验室](https://dtgoi.hhu.edu.cn/main.htm)). My work involved 3D/2D registration, object detection, and image segmentation.

I was involved in three College Students’ Innovation Program projects, one of which was at the national level and two at the university level. During my time at the university, I received multiple university-level scholarships.

In terms of competitions, I have won one national-level award, one provincial-level award, and several university-level awards.

We employed the SAM model for simple annotation of the existing dataset and utilized U-Net for training and prediction. To obtain the tibial midline, we connected the midpoint at the top of the mask with the midpoint of the middle segment. The actual algorithm demonstrated good robustness and recognition performance on the dataset.
